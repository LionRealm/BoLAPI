# BoL API Docs [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/linkpad/BoLAPI.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/linkpad/BoLAPI)

## Contributing

### Prerequisites

You're going to need:

 - **[Ruby](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/), version 1.9.3 or newer**
 - **Bundler** â€” If Ruby is already installed, but the `bundle` command doesn't work, just run `gem install bundler` in a terminal.

### Setup

 1. Fork this repository on GitHub.
 2. Clone *your forked repository* (not our original one)
    `git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/BoLAPI.git`
 3. Open up the Ruby command console.
 3. Type `cd BoLAPI` in the Ruby console.
 4. Install all dependencies: `bundle install`
 5. Start the test server: `bundle exec middleman server`

You can now see the docs at <http://localhost:4567>. Whoa! That was fast!

Now that you have it all setup, you'll probably want to learn more about [editing markdown](https://github.com/tripit/slate/wiki/Markdown-Syntax).

Once you've made the changes you'd feel are needed, push them to your fork and then submit a pull request. Simple as that!
